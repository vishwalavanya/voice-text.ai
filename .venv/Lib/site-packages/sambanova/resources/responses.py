        Only `type: "function"` tools are
        supported; other tool types are filtered server-side. SambaNova is stateless,
        conversation history must be supplied in full via `input[]` on each request.

        Args:
          input: Text input to the model, or a structured list of input items representing the
              full conversation turn. A plain string is equivalent to a single user message.

          model: The model ID to use (e.g. gpt-oss-120b). See available
              [models](https://docs.sambanova.ai/docs/en/models/sambacloud-models)

          background: Accepted for API compatibility and echoed back in the response. Has no effect on
              server behavior.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim. Not currently implemented; accepted for API
              compatibility and echoed in the response.

          instructions: Inserts a system (or developer) message as the first item in the model's
              context. Equivalent to a system-role message prepended to input[].

          max_output_tokens: Upper bound on the number of tokens the model may generate, including visible
              output tokens and reasoning tokens.

          max_tool_calls: Maximum number of tool calls the model may make in a single response turn. Not
              currently implemented; accepted for API compatibility.

          metadata: Included for API compatibility, but not supported

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether the model may issue multiple tool calls in parallel within one turn.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics. Not currently implemented; accepted for API compatibility
              and echoed in the response.

          previous_response_id: Not supported. SambaNova is stateless and does not maintain server-side
              conversation state. Accepted for API compatibility but ignored; clients must
              supply the full conversation history in input[].

          reasoning: Reasoning configuration for models that support it. Ignored on non-reasoning
              models.

          service_tier: Accepted for API compatibility and echoed back in the response. Has no effect on
              server behavior.

          store: SambaNova is stateless - this field is accepted for API compatibility but has no
              effect. Always echoed back as false.

          stream: If true, the response is delivered as server-sent events (SSE).

          temperature: Controls randomness in generation. Range: 0–2. It is recommended to alter this,
              top_p, or top_k but not more than one at a time.

          text: Response format configuration. Supports plain text, json_object, and
              json_schema.

          tool_choice: Controls which tool (if any) the model calls. String values: "none" disables
              tool calls; "auto" lets the model decide; "required" forces at least one tool
              call. To force a specific function, provide a ResponseNamedToolChoice object.

          tools: Tools available to the model. Only type: "function" is supported; all other tool
              types are filtered server-side.

          top_k: Limits sampling to the top K most probable tokens. It is recommended to alter
              this, top_p, or temperature but not more than one at a time.

          top_logprobs: Number of top log-probability entries to return per output token. Null means log
              probabilities are not returned.

          top_p: Nucleus sampling cutoff. Range: 0–1. It is recommended to alter this,
              temperature, or top_k but not more than one at a time.

          truncation: Accepted for API compatibility and echoed in the response. Context truncation
              behavior is not currently configurable via this field in SambaNova.

          user: Included for API compatibility, but only echoed back in response

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

        conversation history must be supplied in full via `input[]` on each request.

        Args:
          input: Text input to the model, or a structured list of input items representing the
              full conversation turn. A plain string is equivalent to a single user message.

          model: The model ID to use (e.g. gpt-oss-120b). See available
              [models](https://docs.sambanova.ai/docs/en/models/sambacloud-models)

          background: Accepted for API compatibility and echoed back in the response. Has no effect on
              server behavior.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim. Not currently implemented; accepted for API
              compatibility and echoed in the response.

          instructions: Inserts a system (or developer) message as the first item in the model's
              context. Equivalent to a system-role message prepended to input[].

          max_output_tokens: Upper bound on the number of tokens the model may generate, including visible
              output tokens and reasoning tokens.

          max_tool_calls: Maximum number of tool calls the model may make in a single response turn. Not
              currently implemented; accepted for API compatibility.

          metadata: Included for API compatibility, but not supported

          parallel_tool_calls: Whether the model may issue multiple tool calls in parallel within one turn.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics. Not currently implemented; accepted for API compatibility
              and echoed in the response.

          previous_response_id: Not supported. SambaNova is stateless and does not maintain server-side
              conversation state. Accepted for API compatibility but ignored; clients must
              supply the full conversation history in input[].

          reasoning: Reasoning configuration for models that support it. Ignored on non-reasoning
              models.

          service_tier: Accepted for API compatibility and echoed back in the response. Has no effect on
              server behavior.

          store: SambaNova is stateless - this field is accepted for API compatibility but has no
              effect. Always echoed back as false.

          stream: If true, the response is delivered as server-sent events (SSE).

          temperature: Controls randomness in generation. Range: 0–2. It is recommended to alter this,
              top_p, or top_k but not more than one at a time.

          text: Response format configuration. Supports plain text, json_object, and
              json_schema.

          tool_choice: Controls which tool (if any) the model calls. String values: "none" disables
              tool calls; "auto" lets the model decide; "required" forces at least one tool
              call. To force a specific function, provide a ResponseNamedToolChoice object.

          tools: Tools available to the model. Only type: "function" is supported; all other tool
              types are filtered server-side.

          top_k: Limits sampling to the top K most probable tokens. It is recommended to alter
              this, top_p, or temperature but not more than one at a time.

          top_logprobs: Number of top log-probability entries to return per output token. Null means log
              probabilities are not returned.

          top_p: Nucleus sampling cutoff. Range: 0–1. It is recommended to alter this,
              temperature, or top_k but not more than one at a time.

          truncation: Accepted for API compatibility and echoed in the response. Context truncation
              behavior is not currently configurable via this field in SambaNova.

          user: Included for API compatibility, but only echoed back in response

              supply the full conversation history in input[].

          reasoning: Reasoning configuration for models that support it. Ignored on non-reasoning
              models.

          service_tier: Accepted for API compatibility and echoed back in the response. Has no effect on
              server behavior.

          store: SambaNova is stateless - this field is accepted for API compatibility but has no
              effect. Always echoed back as false.

          temperature: Controls randomness in generation. Range: 0–2. It is recommended to alter this,
              top_p, or top_k but not more than one at a time.

          text: Response format configuration. Supports plain text, json_object, and
              json_schema.

          tool_choice: Controls which tool (if any) the model calls. String values: "none" disables
              tool calls; "auto" lets the model decide; "required" forces at least one tool
              call. To force a specific function, provide a ResponseNamedToolChoice object.

          tools: Tools available to the model. Only type: "function" is supported; all other tool
              types are filtered server-side.

          top_k: Limits sampling to the top K most probable tokens. It is recommended to alter
              this, top_p, or temperature but not more than one at a time.

          top_logprobs: Number of top log-probability entries to return per output token. Null means log
              probabilities are not returned.

          top_p: Nucleus sampling cutoff. Range: 0–1. It is recommended to alter this,
              temperature, or top_k but not more than one at a time.

          truncation: Accepted for API compatibility and echoed in the response. Context truncation
              behavior is not currently configurable via this field in SambaNova.

          user: Included for API compatibility, but only echoed back in response

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds
