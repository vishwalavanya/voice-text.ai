        Args:
          model: The model ID to use (e.g.

        gpt-oss-120b). See available
              [models](https://docs.sambanova.ai/docs/en/models/sambacloud-models)

          prompt: Prompt to send to the model.

          do_sample: If true, sampling is enabled during output generation. If false, deterministic
              decoding is used.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim. Not currently implemented; accepted for API
              compatibility

          logit_bias: This is not yet supported by our models. Modify the likelihood of specified
              tokens appearing in the completion.

          logprobs: This is not yet supported by our models in completions API. Whether to return
              log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log
              probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`.

          max_completion_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The
              total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
              context length.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The
              total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
              context length.

          n: How many completions to generate for each prompt. **Note:** Because this
              parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota.
              Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens`.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics. Not currently implemented; accepted for API compatibility

          seed: If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically,
              such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return
              the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the
              `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

          stop: Sequences where the API will stop generating tokens. The returned text will not
              contain the stop sequence.

          stream: If set, partial message deltas will be sent. Tokens will be sent as data-only
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
              as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]`
              message.

          stream_options: Options for streaming response. Only set this when setting stream as true

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, determines the degree of randomness in the
              response. between 0 and 2, Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more
              random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
              Is recommended altering this, top_p or top_k but not more than one of these.

          top_k: Amount limit of token choices. An alternative to sampling with temperature, the
              model considers the results of the first K tokens with higher probability. So 10
              means only the first 10 tokens with higher probability are considered. Is
              recommended altering this, top_p or temperature but not more than one of these.

          top_logprobs: This is not yet supported by our models in completions API. An integer between 0
              and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token
              position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to
              `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: Cumulative probability for token choices. An alternative to sampling with
              temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of
              the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising
              the top 10% probability mass are considered. Is recommended altering this, top_k
              or temperature but not more than one of these.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds

          prompt: Prompt to send to the model.

          stream: If set, partial message deltas will be sent. Tokens will be sent as data-only
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
              as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]`
              message.

          do_sample: If true, sampling is enabled during output generation. If false, deterministic
              decoding is used.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim. Not currently implemented; accepted for API
              compatibility

          logit_bias: This is not yet supported by our models. Modify the likelihood of specified
              tokens appearing in the completion.

          logprobs: This is not yet supported by our models in completions API. Whether to return
              log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log
              probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`.

          max_completion_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The
              total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
              context length.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The
              total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
              context length.

          n: How many completions to generate for each prompt. **Note:** Because this
              parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota.
              Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens`.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics. Not currently implemented; accepted for API compatibility

          seed: If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically,
              such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return
              the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the
              `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

          stop: Sequences where the API will stop generating tokens. The returned text will not
              contain the stop sequence.

          stream_options: Options for streaming response. Only set this when setting stream as true

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, determines the degree of randomness in the
              response. between 0 and 2, Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more
              random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
              Is recommended altering this, top_p or top_k but not more than one of these.

          top_k: Amount limit of token choices. An alternative to sampling with temperature, the

        gpt-oss-120b). See available
              [models](https://docs.sambanova.ai/docs/en/models/sambacloud-models)

          prompt: Prompt to send to the model.

          stream: If set, partial message deltas will be sent. Tokens will be sent as data-only
              [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
              as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]`
              message.

          do_sample: If true, sampling is enabled during output generation. If false, deterministic
              decoding is used.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim. Not currently implemented; accepted for API
              compatibility

          logit_bias: This is not yet supported by our models. Modify the likelihood of specified
              tokens appearing in the completion.

          logprobs: This is not yet supported by our models in completions API. Whether to return
              log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log
              probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`.

          max_completion_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The
              total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
              context length.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The
              total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
              context length.

          n: How many completions to generate for each prompt. **Note:** Because this
              parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota.
              Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens`.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics. Not currently implemented; accepted for API compatibility

          seed: If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically,
              such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return
              the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the
              `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

          stop: Sequences where the API will stop generating tokens. The returned text will not
              contain the stop sequence.

          stream_options: Options for streaming response. Only set this when setting stream as true

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, determines the degree of randomness in the
              response. between 0 and 2, Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more
              random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
              Is recommended altering this, top_p or top_k but not more than one of these.

          top_k: Amount limit of token choices. An alternative to sampling with temperature, the
              model considers the results of the first K tokens with higher probability. So 10
              means only the first 10 tokens with higher probability are considered. Is
              recommended altering this, top_p or temperature but not more than one of these.

          top_logprobs: This is not yet supported by our models in completions API. An integer between 0
              and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token
              position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to
              `true` if this parameter is used.

          top_p: Cumulative probability for token choices. An alternative to sampling with
              temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of
              the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising
